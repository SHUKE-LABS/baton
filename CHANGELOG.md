# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here.

Baton is installed by pinning a git tag (see [README](README.md#install)), and
stability is an explicit non-goal at 0.1.0 — breaking changes are expected
between tags. This file records what a tag bump includes, so a consumer can
decide whether to re-pin deliberately. Versions do **not** yet follow semantic
versioning.

_Generated from release tags with `bash scripts/release.sh generate-changelog`._
