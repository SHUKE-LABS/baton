//! The file-mailbox: an addressable, crash-safe on-disk queue for `baton serve`.
//!
//! Where [`crate::participant`] answers one envelope in memory, a mailbox gives
//! that answer an *asynchronous, addressable* home on disk: a sender drops a
//! `baton.message/v1` request file into `pending/` and a `baton serve` daemon
//! picks it up later, answers it through the [`Participant`](crate::participant)
//! seam, and writes the reply to an outbox. Everything is a file — the "reach"
//! is the filesystem, not a socket.
//!
//! ## State machine
//!
//! Each message moves `pending → claimed → done`, one atomic `rename(2)` per
//! transition (a rename within a directory is atomic on a local filesystem, so
//! a reader never observes a half-written or half-moved message):
//!
//! - **deliver** — write a temp file, then `rename` it into `pending/<id>.json`.
//! - **claim** — `rename(pending → claimed)`; the rename *is* the lock. A second
//!   claimant racing for the same file loses with `ENOENT` and moves on.
//! - **complete** — `rename(claimed → done)`; `done/` doubles as the dedup
//!   ledger, so a redelivered id already in `done/` is dropped, not reprocessed.
//!   Nothing prunes it on its own: the ledger is bounded only by an operator's
//!   [`prune_done`] (`baton mailbox prune`), which trades ledger size for the
//!   length of the redelivery-dedup window.
//! - **reclaim** — on startup the sole live instance moves any `claimed/` entry
//!   a prior crash abandoned back to `pending/`, so no in-flight message is lost.
//!
//! ## Single-instance lock
//!
//! [`Mailbox::open`] takes an exclusive advisory lock ([`std::fs::File::try_lock`])
//! on a lockfile at the mailbox root; a second `serve` on the same root fails to
//! open. This is what makes [`reclaim_stale`](Mailbox::reclaim_stale) safe:
//! reclaim runs only at the start of the one live instance, so it can never move
//! a `claimed/` message another daemon is mid-`respond()` on. The lock is
//! advisory and per-host — reliable on a local filesystem, not across NFS.
//!
//! ## Delivery semantics
//!
//! Processing is **at-least-once**, not exactly-once: an abrupt kill (SIGKILL /
//! OOM / power loss) between `respond()` and `complete()` leaves the message in
//! `claimed/`, and the next start reclaims and reprocesses it — a repeat provider
//! call and possibly a second response. Response files are keyed by the *request*
//! id (see [`deliver_response`](Mailbox::deliver_response)) so a reprocess
//! overwrites its own not-yet-consumed reply rather than appending a second;
//! consumers still correlate/dedup on `in_reply_to` / `conversation_id`.
