//! `baton task`: a service-owned asynchronous job, run and reaped by
//! [`crate::service`]'s control-plane loop on behalf of a headless
//! `baton serve --agent-cmd` turn that has already exited.
//!
//! This module holds the wire-format contract only — [`TaskSpec`],
//! [`TaskCommand`], [`TaskRecord`], [`TaskEventKind`], deterministic event-id
//! derivation, and the injectable [`Clock`] seam. The actual spawn/track/reap
//! loop lives in [`crate::service`] (see `run_service`), which already owns
//! the durable control-plane directories and process-group kill primitives a
//! task reuses.
//!
//! ## Deterministic event ids
//!
//! An event id is composed only from the task id, its event kind, and — for a
//! milestone — that milestone's configured index: no wall-clock or fire-time
//! input (see [`task_event_id`]). Delivering the same id twice is safe without
//! any hashing dependency: the mailbox's own `done/` dedup
//! ([`crate::mailbox::Mailbox::claim_next`]) drops an exact-id redelivery once
//! the first delivery has been consumed.
//!
//! ## Injectable clock
//!
//! Milestone and max-duration checks compare elapsed milliseconds against a
//! [`Clock`], not a bare `SystemTime`/`Instant` call, so a test can drive the
//! task loop's timing decisions deterministically (see [`FakeClock`]) instead
//! of sleeping in wall-clock time.
