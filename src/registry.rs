//! Static name → mailbox routing registry.
//!
//! An N-party conversation ring ([`crate::converse::converse_ring`]) addresses
//! its members by name, but a name is not a location: the driver needs a
//! concrete `{inbox, outbox}` pair to build each remote peer's
//! [`MailboxParticipant`](crate::participant::MailboxParticipant). This registry
//! is that lookup — a file loaded **once at startup**, mapping each participant
//! name to its mailbox pair.
//!
//! It is *pure lookup*: it holds no governance and makes no policy decision. The
//! driver remains the sole governance authority; the registry only answers
//! "where does a message to `alice` go?". Names are validated with the same
//! [`is_safe_key`](crate::mailbox::is_safe_key) guard the mailbox uses, so a
//! hostile name cannot escape the mailbox root via path components. Resolution
//! fails fast — an unknown name is a startup error, consistent with round-robin
//! never producing an unroutable name at runtime.
//!
//! ## Config format (JSON)
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "participants": {
//!     "alice": { "inbox": "/tmp/alice/inbox", "outbox": "/tmp/alice/outbox" },
//!     "bob":   { "inbox": "/tmp/bob/inbox",   "outbox": "/tmp/bob/outbox" }
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
