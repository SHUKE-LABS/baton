//! The participant seam: an envelope-in / envelope-out boundary.
//!
//! [`Participant`] is the A2A analog of [`crate::transport::Transport`]. Where a
//! `Transport` hides *which provider* answers a call, a `Participant` hides
//! *which participant* answers a `baton.message/v1` envelope — in-process here,
//! subprocess (M3b) or mailbox (M4) later. The boundary is envelope-only: a
//! participant holds no state shared with any other, so the M3c driver can hold
//! one abstractly and reach it the same way regardless of how it is realised.
//!
//! [`LocalParticipant`] is the first implementation: an in-process, LLM-backed
//! participant that is a system prompt + a [`Transport`]. It carries the same
//! request-envelope → response-envelope transformation the `baton exchange`
//! verb performs, so the two share one source of truth (the verb delegates
//! here); the CLI layers the `BATON_EVENT_LOG` side trail on top.
