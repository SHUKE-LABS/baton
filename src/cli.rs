//! Command-line entry surface for Baton.
//!
//! This module owns the boundary between process entry and the runtime. It
//! parses arguments, loads configuration, and drives the exchange via the
//! [`Transport`] boundary.
//!
//! The commands: `baton ask -p "..."` is single-turn (one prompt in, one reply
//! out); `baton session` is an interactive REPL accumulating a [`Conversation`]
//! and resending the full history each turn; `baton exchange` is the A2A
//! request/reply verb (one `baton.message/v1` envelope in, one out); `baton log
//! show`/`replay` inspects and re-runs the recorded trail. Argument parsing
//! ([`parse_args`]) and the exchanges themselves are kept abstract over their
//! collaborators and sink-agnostic so every branch is unit-testable without a
//! network or real environment: [`execute_ask`] / [`execute_session`] over a
//! [`Transport`], and [`execute_exchange`] over a
//! [`Participant`](crate::participant::Participant) — mirroring
//! [`BatonConfig::from_lookup`](crate::config::BatonConfig::from_lookup).
//!
//! Each exchange is also recorded as structured JSONL via an [`EventSink`] when
//! `BATON_EVENT_LOG` names a file (see [`open_event_sink`]). Recording is
//! auxiliary: for `ask`, stdout stays "assistant text and nothing else", and a
//! failed event write degrades to a stderr warning rather than failing the
//! command.
//!
//! Streaming and tool execution remain out of scope.

/// Each line read from `input` becomes a user turn appended to `conversation`;
/// the full accumulated history is sent on every request, so turn N carries all
/// prior user and assistant turns. The assistant reply is printed to `output`
/// (and appended as the next turn). Blank lines are ignored; EOF or a lone
/// [`SESSION_EXIT_COMMAND`] line ends the loop cleanly (the caller returns exit
/// code 0).
///
/// `output` carries only assistant replies — one per turn — so it stays useful
/// to a programmatic consumer; the greeting banner and any error go to stderr.
///
/// A turn that fails at the transport layer is **not** fatal: the error is
/// reported on stderr and the loop continues. The failed user turn is rolled
/// back out of the history so it never produces two consecutive same-role turns,
/// which the Messages API rejects. Each turn still emits a `request` plus one
/// `response_ok`/`response_error` event, exactly like `ask`.
///
/// `session_id` frames every turn's `request`; `turn_index` is the next turn's
/// index (0 for a fresh session, the continuation for a resumed one) and counts
/// only turns whose `request` is emitted, so it is bumped after a turn is
/// dispatched, not per input line. The caller owns the opening `session_start`
/// (a fresh session emits one; a resumed session reuses the trail's existing
/// frame); this loop always closes with a `session_end` on a clean exit.
