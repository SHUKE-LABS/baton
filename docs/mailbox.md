# Mailbox transport: `serve`, `send`, `status`

The asynchronous, file-backed transport: a long-lived responder, the client that
posts to it and consumes the correlated reply, the liveness probe over the same
mailbox, the operator prune that bounds its dedup ledger, and the routing registry
that resolves a role name to a mailbox pair.

## Serving a mailbox (`baton serve`)

Where `exchange` is a synchronous round-trip over pipes, `baton serve` gives that
exchange an **asynchronous, addressable** home on disk: a sender drops a
`baton.message/v1` request file into an inbox, and a long-lived `serve` process
picks it up later, answers it through the same participant seam, and writes the
reply to an outbox. Everything is a file — the reach is the filesystem, not a
socket.

```
baton serve --inbox <dir> --outbox <dir> [--poll-ms <n>] [--once]
            [--agent-cmd <program> [--agent-arg <arg>]... [--agent-cwd <dir>] [--agent-timeout-ms <n>]
             [--agent-output raw|json [--agent-result-key <key>]]]
            [--role <name>]
baton serve --stop --inbox <dir>
```

- `--inbox <dir>` — the mailbox root. `serve` manages `pending/`, `claimed/`, and
  `done/` subdirectories under it.
- `--outbox <dir>` — where response envelopes are written.
- `--poll-ms <n>` — inbox poll interval in milliseconds (default `500`).
- `--once` — drain everything currently pending, then exit (cron-friendly);
  omitted, `serve` polls the inbox until terminated.
- `--agent-cmd <program>` — host the role with an **external agent** (see
  [External-agent role](external-agent.md#external-agent-role---agent-cmd)).
  This is the only answering path a default, harness-only build has — `serve`
  refuses to start without it (an in-process provider fallback exists only in
  legacy `--features local` builds).
- `--role <name>` — resolve the answering identity from the role's
  [home directory](configuration.md#role-homes-rolesname) (`roles/<name>/`), so a party is stood
  up by name instead of hand-assembled env vars. In-process mode (legacy
  `--features local` builds) feeds the role's
  layered config (model, base URL, credential, system prompt, timeouts) to the
  provider call; agent mode fills `--agent-cwd` from the role's `cwd` when the
  flag is not passed — baton stops there, since it carries no other
  agent-specific knowledge. **Explicit flags and env always override the role**
  (`flag > env > role config > defaults > default`). With `--role`, each answered
  exchange is also recorded as a per-role
  [session](configuration.md#per-role-session-recording) under
  `roles/<name>/sessions/<conversation_id>.jsonl`.
- `--stop` — cooperatively stop the `serve` running on `--inbox` (see
  [Shutdown](#shutdown-cooperative-graceful-stop)); takes only `--inbox`.

Without `--agent-cmd` (legacy `--features local` builds only), each side
configures the answering participant exactly as `exchange`/`ask` do
(`BATON_MODEL`, `BATON_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, the credential env, `BATON_EVENT_LOG`),
so a served message runs the identical exchange and records the same trail. A
`--role` supplies these same values from the role's home when the env leaves
them unset.

After participant setup, mailbox lock acquisition, stale-stop handling, and
stale-claim reclamation all succeed, `serve` writes and flushes the exact line
`baton serve: ready` to stdout before it begins polling. A launcher may use this
line as a readiness barrier; it is not emitted when startup fails and it does
not claim that any request has been answered yet.

### Delivery: atomic, addressable, crash-safe

A sender delivers by writing a temp file and `rename(2)`-ing it into the inbox,
so `serve` never observes a partial envelope. Each message then moves through one
atomic rename per state: `pending → claimed → done`. A crash mid-answer leaves
the message in `claimed/`; the next start **reclaims** it back to `pending/`, so
no in-flight message is lost. The response is written to
`<outbox>/<request message_id>.json` — keyed by the *request* id (the reply's
`in_reply_to`), so a reprocessed message overwrites its own not-yet-consumed
reply instead of leaving a second file.

### Single instance

`serve` takes an exclusive advisory lock (std `File::try_lock`, stable since Rust
1.89) on the mailbox root at startup; a second `serve` on the same root exits
non-zero rather than running concurrently. This is what makes reclaim safe —
reclaim runs only in the one live instance, so it can never move a `claimed/`
message another daemon is mid-answer on. The lock is advisory and per-host:
reliable on a local filesystem, **not** across NFS/network filesystems (a mailbox
shared between hosts reintroduces the race and is out of scope).

### At-least-once semantics

Processing is **at-least-once**, not exactly-once. An abrupt kill (SIGKILL / OOM
/ power loss) between answering and marking `done` is safe for *delivery* — the
message is reclaimed and reprocessed — but that reprocess is a repeat provider
call and may emit a **second** response envelope. Consumers must therefore
correlate/dedup on `in_reply_to` / `conversation_id`. Keyed outbox writes shrink
the common (unconsumed) case to a single file; they do not make it exactly-once.

### Shutdown (cooperative graceful stop)

A raw `SIGTERM`/`SIGKILL` mid-answer is *safe for delivery* — the message is
reclaimed and reprocessed on the next start — but that reprocess is a repeat
provider call and may emit a second response envelope. To avoid that redundant
reprocess on an *expected* stop (systemd stop, `docker stop`, deploy), stop the
daemon cooperatively instead:

```
baton serve --stop --inbox <dir>
```

`--stop` drops a stop sentinel at the mailbox root; the running daemon consumes
it **between messages** and exits `0`, so an in-flight `respond()` is never
interrupted mid-call. It detects a live daemon by probing the single-instance
lock: if no daemon holds the lock it writes nothing (so a stale sentinel can
never kill a later fresh `serve`) and reports that nothing is running — still
exiting `0`, since a cooperative stop is idempotent. Wire it as systemd
`ExecStop=baton serve --stop --inbox <dir>`.

`--stop` is the **only** graceful path: `serve` installs no signal handler and
does not react to a raw `SIGTERM` (Option A semantics — the crash-safe FSM,
without signal reaction, is the shipped default). Graceful completion is bounded
by the supervisor's stop timeout (systemd `TimeoutStopSec`): if the in-flight
message does not finish before it expires, the supervisor signals the daemon
anyway and delivery falls back to the reclaim-and-reprocess path above.

There is also no zero-downtime handover: a restart has a brief window where the
second `serve` is refused until the first exits.

The client side of this mailbox — posting a request and reading the correlated
reply — is [`baton send`](#posting-to-a-mailbox-baton-send).

### Agent stderr capture (`--agent-cmd` only)

When `serve` runs an external agent (`--agent-cmd`), the agent's stderr is
captured on every turn — success and failure alike. Where it ends up depends
on how the turn concludes:

- **Exit 0, turn succeeds** — stderr is persisted to
  `<inbox>/agent-stderr/<message-id>.stderr`.
- **Exit 0, turn fails a decode check** (empty stdout, an unextractable
  result, or an empty result) — stderr is **also** persisted to that same
  path; the delivered `BatonError::Decode` message does not inline it, so the
  file is the only place to see it.
- **Non-zero exit or timeout** — stderr is inlined into the
  `BatonError::Transport` error message instead; nothing is written to disk.

This mirrors the per-task `<control>/task-logs/<task-id>/stderr.log` convention
established by `baton task start` (see [Service § Task
lifecycle](service.md#task-lifecycle-baton-task)). The directory is created on
the first write.

Stderr is capped at **1 MiB** per turn; output beyond the cap is discarded and a
`[truncated at 1 MiB]` marker is appended. The persist is best-effort: a write
failure (disk full, permissions) does not turn a successful agent turn into an
error.

Stdout is capped at **8 MiB** per turn. When output exceeds the cap, the front
of the output is discarded and the final 8 MiB are retained, with a
`[truncated at 8 MiB: output prefix dropped; retained tail begins below]`
marker prepended. Tail retention preserves a final JSON result line for
`--agent-output json` while keeping the daemon's captured reply bounded.

## Posting to a mailbox (`baton send`)

`baton send` is the producer for a mailbox: it drops a `baton.message/v1` request
into `<inbox>/pending/` over the same atomic temp-file + `rename(2)` path `serve`
consumes, and with `--await` reads back the correlated reply. It is the reference
client for `serve`'s at-least-once contract. Unlike `serve` it takes **no**
single-instance lock, so it posts to an inbox a live `serve` already owns; and it
runs no provider call, so it needs no credential.

```
baton send (--inbox <dir> | --registry <path>) (--body <text> [--to <role>] | --in <path>) [--from <id>] [--conversation <id>] [--await [--outbox <dir>] [--timeout-ms <n>]]
```

- `--inbox <dir>` — the mailbox root; the request is written to its `pending/`.
  Mutually exclusive with `--registry`.
- `--registry <path>` — resolve the destination by **role name** instead of a
  path (same registry format as `converse-ring`). The addressee role — the
  `--body` `--to <role>`, or the `--in` envelope's own `to` — is looked up to its
  `{inbox, outbox}` pair; an unknown role fails fast. The registry supplies the
  `--await` outbox, so `--outbox` is not passed with `--registry`.
- `--body <text>` — build a request envelope around this body. `--to`/`--from`/
  `--conversation` override its addressing (defaults `agent-b`/`agent-a` and a
  time-derived conversation id); the `message_id` is derived so no external id
  source is needed. With `--registry`, `--to <role>` is required (it is both the
  routing key and the envelope `to`).
- `--in <path>` — read a complete envelope from a file instead (mutually
  exclusive with `--body`; the addressing flags do not apply — the envelope
  carries its own; with `--registry` its `to` is the routing role).
- `--await` — after delivering, wait for the reply and print it to stdout. Needs
  `--outbox <dir>` unless `--registry` resolves it.
- `--outbox <dir>` — where `serve` writes replies (`<outbox>/<message_id>.json`).
- `--timeout-ms <n>` — how long `--await` waits before giving up (default
  `30000`).

Without `--await`, `send` prints the sent `message_id` to stdout and exits. With
`--await`, the `message_id` confirmation goes to stderr and **stdout carries only
the reply envelope** (one JSON line), so a consumer can pipe it straight into a
parser.

### Await: claim, correlate, and the at-least-once caveat

`--await` polls `<outbox>/<message_id>.json`; on appearance it **atomically
renames the reply out of the outbox to claim ownership**, then reads it. The
rename is the claim: it prevents a concurrent `--await` — or a reappearing
reclaim-driven second response — from double-consuming the same file. (It is not
about partial reads; the atomic write already rules those out.) The consumed
reply's `in_reply_to` must equal the sent `message_id`, or `send` errors rather
than accept an uncorrelated reply.

The await is bounded to the single invocation: on timeout `send` exits non-zero,
the request is left in the mailbox, and it does **not** re-await across runs.
Because a claimed reply is renamed away, a later reclaim-driven **second**
response (the at-least-once tail described under `serve`) reappears as a fresh
outbox file and would be handed to a *subsequent* `--await` — so consumers dedup
on `in_reply_to` / `conversation_id`, exactly as they must for `serve`.

Both the send and the consumed reply are recorded to `BATON_EVENT_LOG` (as
`message_sent` / `reply_consumed` lines on the same trail), when it is set.

## Mailbox liveness (`baton status`)

`baton status` reports whether a mailbox's worker is idle, actively running, or
crashed — the signal a team's gate-check reads before starting a cycle. The naive
test `idle = pending empty AND claimed empty` cannot tell a legitimately long run
from a crash: both leave a `claimed/` entry (this is why
[reclaim](#at-least-once-semantics) exists). `status` splits that ambiguity by
**claim age** against a max-runtime threshold — there is **no heartbeat protocol**.

```
baton status (--mailbox <root> | --registry <path> --role <role>) [--max-runtime-ms <n>]
```

- `--mailbox <root>` — probe this mailbox root directly.
- `--registry <path> --role <role>` — resolve the mailbox by role name (same
  registry as `send`/`converse-ring`); an unknown role fails fast.
- `--max-runtime-ms <n>` — the crashed-stale threshold, in milliseconds. Precedence:
  this flag > the role's `max_runtime_ms` in the registry (see below) > a built-in
  default. It **must sit above the worst-case legitimate agent run**, or a
  slow-but-alive worker is misread as crashed.

It prints one JSON line and exits 0:

```json
{"state":"busy","queue_depth":2,"claim_age_ms":4200,"max_runtime_ms":900000}
```

- `state` — `idle-done` (no claim), `busy` (a claim younger than the threshold),
  or `crashed-stale` (a claim older than the threshold).
- `queue_depth` — the number of requests waiting in `pending/`.
- `claim_age_ms` — the oldest claim's age in milliseconds, or `null` when idle.

The probe is **lock-free**: it reads `pending/` and `claimed/` without taking the
single-instance lock, so it safely inspects a mailbox a live `serve` owns. A
claim's age is measured from **when it was claimed** — `claim_next` stamps the
claim time onto the file — so a request that waited in `pending/` is not misread as
instantly stale.

**Reclaim hazard (documented boundary).** A `crashed-stale` claim is recovered by
`serve`'s [at-least-once reclaim](#at-least-once-semantics) on the next start,
which re-runs the abandoned message — possibly re-running a side-effecting agent (a
double commit / PR). Two mitigations are required: (a) the threshold above sits
above the worst-case legitimate run, so a live worker is never falsely reclaimed;
and (b) correctness on re-run relies on the agent's **idempotency via durable
artifacts** — on re-run it observes its own prior branch/commit and adapts.

### Per-role threshold in the registry

A registry entry may carry an optional `max_runtime_ms`, used by `status
--registry --role` when no `--max-runtime-ms` override is given:

```json
{
  "participants": {
    "reviewer": { "inbox": "/tmp/reviewer/inbox", "outbox": "/tmp/reviewer/outbox", "max_runtime_ms": 1200000 }
  }
}
```

The field is optional and back-compatible: existing registries without it parse
unchanged and fall back to the `status` default.

## Pruning the dedup ledger (`baton mailbox prune`)

`done/` is not just an archive — it **is** the redelivery-dedup ledger
([at-least-once semantics](#at-least-once-semantics)): `claim_next` drops a
redelivered id because a file for it is sitting in `done/`. Nothing removes those
files on their own, so a long-lived `serve` daemon accumulates one permanent file
per processed message. `baton mailbox prune` is the operator's bound on that
growth.

```
baton mailbox prune --mailbox <root> --older-than <duration>
```

- `--mailbox <root>` — the mailbox root to prune, the same root `serve --inbox`
  and `status --mailbox` name.
- `--older-than <duration>` — the retention window. Every `done/` entry whose
  mtime is at least this old is deleted. An integer with an optional unit
  suffix — `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, `d` — and a bare integer is milliseconds, as
  everywhere else in the CLI: `7d`, `48h`, `900000`.

It prints one JSON line and exits 0:

```json
{"removed":12,"older_than_ms":604800000}
```

**The trade-off: pruning shortens the dedup window.** A duplicate is suppressed
only while its `done/` entry survives. Prune with `--older-than 7d` and a message
redelivered eight days later is treated as new and reprocessed — a repeat provider
call, and for an `--agent-cmd` worker a repeat agent run. Size the window above
the longest delay after which a sender could plausibly redeliver, not merely above
the time the reply took.

This is why pruning is **never automatic**: only an operator can decide that a
duplicate arriving after the cutoff may be reprocessed. Two consequences of the
same rule:

- **The window must be strictly positive.** `--older-than 0` is a usage error, not
  a shorthand for "prune everything" — the cutoff is `age >= window`, so a zero
  window matches every entry and one typo would wipe the ledger. Clearing it
  outright stays an explicit `rm` you type yourself, with dedup disabled for every
  id you removed.
- **A future-dated entry always survives.** A clock skew that stamps an entry in
  the future clamps its age to zero, and zero never reaches a positive window.

Pruning is scoped to `done/`: `pending/` and `claimed/` are never touched, so it
can neither drop an unanswered request nor abandon an in-flight one. Like
[`status`](#mailbox-liveness-baton-status) it is **lock-free**, so it can prune a
mailbox a live `serve` daemon owns — an entry the daemon writes while the scan
runs is simply seen by the next prune.

## Routing registry (name → mailbox)

The registry is a **static** JSON file mapping each participant name to its
`{inbox, outbox}` mailbox **pair** — each peer is its own [`baton serve`](#serving-a-mailbox-baton-serve)
daemon with its own inbox and outbox. It is pure lookup: it holds **no**
governance (the driver remains the sole governance authority) and performs no
routing beyond name resolution. Names are validated as safe mailbox keys, so a
name cannot escape the mailbox root via path components.

```json
{
  "participants": {
    "alice": { "inbox": "/tmp/alice/inbox", "outbox": "/tmp/alice/outbox" },
    "bob":   { "inbox": "/tmp/bob/inbox",   "outbox": "/tmp/bob/outbox" },
    "carol": { "inbox": "/tmp/carol/inbox", "outbox": "/tmp/carol/outbox" }
  }
}
```

| Field                    | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `participants`           | Object mapping each participant name to its mailbox pair.               |
| `participants.<name>.inbox`  | The peer `serve`'s `--inbox`; requests land in `<inbox>/pending/`.  |
| `participants.<name>.outbox` | The peer `serve`'s `--outbox`; replies are claimed keyed by request id. |

The registry answers only *where* a name's messages go, never *who* that name
is. A party's **role-owned identity** — system prompt, model, credential, and
cwd — lives in its [role home](configuration.md#role-homes-rolesname) (`roles/<name>/`), and
each ring member is its own `baton serve --role <name>` daemon that loads it.
External-agent MCP configuration remains caller-owned and must be supplied
through the `--agent-cmd` wrapper or `--agent-arg` passthrough. So the two
surfaces stay cleanly split: the registry is pure routing, the role home stores
Baton-supported identity, and standing up a party is "add a `roles/<name>/`
directory + a registry entry", not hand-assembling per-process env.

**Non-goals (v1).** The registry is deliberately minimal:

- **No convention-derived paths** (`<root>/<name>/…`) — a possible later
  zero-config layer over the explicit registry.
- **No dynamic discovery** (register / heartbeat / liveness / join-leave) — the
  roster is fixed for the run.
- **No `to`-based routing** — the driver picks the next recipient by ring order;
  the registry only resolves names to mailboxes.
